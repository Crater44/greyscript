# Security Policy

Due to the nature of the extension, security vulnerabilities should be *very* rare, however just in case:

## Supported Versions

The latest version of the extension is the only supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send a DM over Discord to WyattL#3477, or alternatively, send a [email instead](mailto:wslipsc1@stu.k12.wv.us).

All reports should have a initial response within 24 hours, and should be fixed within approximately 72 hours.
